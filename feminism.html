    <p>I am a feminist.</p>
<p>That is, I believe that men and women are born equal and that any apparent differences in their capacities are only a result of biased interaction with the environment which we must strive to remove.</p>
<p>Currently in practice, there are two kinds of feminism.</p>
<ol>
<li>The sensible feminism which is inclusive of both genders and aims at bringing together both genders.</li>
<li><a href="#extremist-feminism">The extremism where women label everything that a man does/says &quot;sexist&quot; and attack men whenever possible.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>It is obvious that I belong to the first category.</p>
<h2 id="discrimination">Discrimination</h2>
<p>Gender discrimination is so prevalent and systematized that we often fail to see where they exist. Here&#39;s a list of links which point things out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://kafila.org/2015/03/28/an-open-letter-to-kerala-khap-managers-and-madam-principal-cet-in-particular-and-to-malayalees-in-general/">An Open Letter to Kerala Khap Managers and Madam Principal, CET, in Particular, and to Malayalees in General</a>: talks about schools and colleges putting restrictions on what a girl can do, and how she must behave within the bounds of their institution and sometimes even outside. Unfair curfews at hostels under the pretext of security, for example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rape">Rape</h2>
<p>It is a violent crime perpetuated by common people when they think the conditions are right.</p>
<h2 id="organizations">Organizations</h2>
<p>These organizations are feminist.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://heforshe.org/">HeForShe</a> - an international organization with Emma Watson leading it.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.blanknoise.org/">Blank Noise</a> is a movement which encourages action heroes to do things like they would want to do without having to listen to patriarchies. It is active in many cities of India.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="india-s-daughter">India&#39;s Daughter</h2>
<p><a href="../indias-daughter/">India&#39;s Daughter</a> - A documentary by Leslee Udwin about December 16 gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh in Delhi. It documents the attitude of the guilty, their guilty lawyers, victim&#39;s friends and relatives, the public, and the judiciary. Some horrifying defences by the lawyers of the guilty - like &quot;A woman is a flower, she should be protected, a man is like thorn, strong and tough.&quot;, and so many more worse things. Read the controversies surrounding it <a href="../indias-daughter/">here</a></p>
<h2 id="bollywood">Bollywood</h2>
<p>I am absolutely sure that Bollywood plays the biggest role in perpetuating patriarchical culture and an image of women that they are sex objects. In fact, I did a small not so scientific study to see <a href="../focus-in-movie-songs/">what is focussed in Bollywood songs</a>. You can see the results for yourself.</p>
<h3 id="deepika-padukone">Deepika Padukone</h3>
<p>Deepika had a cleavage row in which she blamed TOI for focussing on her cleavage. But <a href="http://qr.ae/BLqSR">I call Deepika a hypocrite, read about it on quora</a></p>
<p>But she also featured in this Vogue campaign called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtPv7IEhWRA">&quot;My Choice&quot;</a> to which an apt reply would be <a href="http://theladiesfinger.com/what-vogue-said-what-we-heard/">this</a> and which probably belong to <a href="#extremist-feminism">extremist feminism</a></p>
<p>She apparently holds this opinion on feminism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;New feminism isn&#39;t about being aggressive; it&#39;s about reaching the top yet being soft. It&#39;s about being you — feminine, strong and full of will power.&quot; <footer><a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Uw-XCvE9G4YC&amp;q=new+feminism#v=snippet&amp;q=new%20feminism&amp;f=false">Consumer India</a></footer></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="extremist-feminism">Extremist Feminism</h2>
<p>Extremist feminism is what some irrational females end up doing by blaming men for any action they do. They would even consider using the word &quot;female&quot; as a sexist remark.</p>
<p>Here are examples of how they create more problems than solve (if any)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/">A Dongle Joke That Spiraled Way Out Of Control</a></li>

</ul>
