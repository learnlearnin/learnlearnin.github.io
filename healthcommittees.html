    <p>Think</p>
<ul>
<li>How is the health system of India the way it is? (PHCs, CHCs, District Hospitals, free/cheap treatment, etc)</li>
<li>What shapes the <a href="../publichealth/">Health Policy</a> of a country?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To begin with</strong>, there was no India. And in the geographic region that constituted India in the past, there were many systems of medicine being practised - ayurveda, unani, etc.</p>
<p><strong>While Europeans came to India</strong>, they also brought with them the idea of modern medicine. Slowly there were allopathic hospitals being built.</p>
<p><strong>1938</strong>: Towards the end of British rule the Indian National Congress was assuming more and more power in India&#39;s matters. They set up the National Planning Commission in 1938 to plan for an independent India, which in turn set up the Sokhey&#39;s committee.</p>
<p><strong>1940</strong>: This National Planning Committee adopted a resolution based on the <em>Sokhey&#39;s committee</em> recommendations and started thinking about health of the country - preventing &amp; curing diseases, training people to do so.</p>
<p><strong>1943-46</strong>: They set up <strong>Bhore committee</strong> called Health Survery and Development Committee which did all the hard work of visiting places, finding out what&#39;s happening, why a lot of people are dying, how to prevent it, etc.</p>
<p><strong>1947</strong>: India gains independence. Is all alone.</p>
