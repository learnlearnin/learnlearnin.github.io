        <p>I have spent countless hours learning a lot of stuff. Learning all that was fun, otherwise I would never do that. But at some point during the journey I realized that simply learning is not enough.</p>
        <p>I realized that the difficulties I had in understanding particular topics, will be faced by anyone else who is trying to understand the same.</p>
        <p>And I realized that I can help countless people avoid at least those problems I faced by writing down how I made my way across those. And that is why I started this website.</p>
        <p>I am available for any kind of help.</p>
