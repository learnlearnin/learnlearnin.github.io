    <p>What does it mean to learn?</p>
<p>Dr Shekar, my professor of Medicine used to say that there are a lot many levels of learning.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy">Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy</a> helps us talk about learning.</p>
<p>Domains of learning</p>
<ol>
<li>Cognitive (knowing)</li>
<li>Affective (feeling)</li>
<li>Psychomotor (doing)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;m interested in cognitive learning. It can be considered as having different levels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge</li>
<li>Comprehension</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Analysis</li>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Synthesis</li>
</ul>
<p>As you go down the above list you realize that the effectiveness of learning increases. So, our learning should always be about preparing us to synthesize knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
<p>When there&#39;s a moderate amount of information and there&#39;s only one day for an exam, when we are cramming, we improve knowledge.</p>
<p>But two-three days before, if we are reading, we would also be comprehending.</p>
<p>If after an exam we are asked to implement the knowledge in some practical project, we reach the application level. It is not necessary that we actually do a project, we can simulate a project in our mind.</p>
<p>These three levels are usually followed by students in the normal course of their life.</p>
<p>Analysis is breaking down the knowledge into constituent parts and identifying their relations to each other. This is done through analogies, stories, hypothetical &quot;reasons&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Evaluation is when we start thinking about the knowledge and its application to real life. About how effective that is in real life.</p>
<p>Synthesis is when we come up with alternative solutions to problems we discover during evaluation.</p>
<p>By its nature, the latter three takes some time while doing. And that is probably why students avoid these. Time management might help.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>I like <a href="http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~mohanan/educ/openbook.pdf">open book exams</a>. It is difficult for a teacher to create an open book question paper and that is probably why these kind of tests are rarely seen.</p>
<p>I like frequent examinations. Once a week is ideal.</p>
