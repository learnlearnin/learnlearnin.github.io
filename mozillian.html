    <p><a href="../mozilla/">Mozilla</a> is a large community of people who love and protect the open Web. This is my story around being a Mozillian.</p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>If my memory serves me right, I got my first computer (Intel Pentium IV with a nice LCD screen, 256MB RAM, 80 GB HDD) in February, 2006 and it took me about 1  and a half years till September 2007 to figure out <a href="../keep-in-touch/">how to connect</a> BSNL landline to the modem port and get connected to the Internet with a dialup connection. Till then I was changing the font colors (to red on yellow) and desktop icons and keeping track of FIFA world cup on a spreadsheet I created that&#39;d automatically figure out the points, winners, and draws. Encarta encyclopedia was my everything.</p>
<p>Once I was connected to Internet, it all changed. I was on Orkut, and a lot of other websites, and learning about a vast number of things. And in April 2008 I set up <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com">my blog</a>. A point to note here is that this is the point at which I had my first meeting with FOSS philosophy. I installed BOSS Linux (an Indian GNU/Linux flavor) in March that year.</p>
<p>I kept trying out different browsers - IE, Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Avant, <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2008/09/greenbrowser-nice-browser-to-deal-with.html">GreenBrowser</a>(?). It must be around the launch of Firefox 3.5 that I really got attracted to and stuck with Firefox.</p>
<p>So my love for Mozilla begins around August, 2009. Firefox had hit 1 billion downloads and I <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2009/08/thats-one-great-browser-for-fans-one.html">took part</a> in the download campaign by being an affiliate. <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/?from=sfx&amp;uid=275742&amp;t=450">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/?from=sfx&amp;uid=275742&amp;t=450</a> was the affiliate link (for old time&#39;s sake). BTW, <a href="http://affiliates.mozilla.org/link/banner/55725">download Firefox now</a> (new affiliate link)</p>
<p>And then I began <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2009/08/have-rocking-browsing-experience-for.html">downloading add-ons, decorating</a>, <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2011/03/syncing-firefox-history-bookmarks-and.html">setting up and maintaining multiple profiles</a>, all that crazy things fans do.</p>
<p>Creating a Firefox add-on was added to <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/p/my-bucket-list.html">my bucket list</a> in around 2011. (And I <a href="../zero-internet/">achieved that</a> in 2015).</p>
<p>And Firefox had sown the seeds of love for Mozilla and open Web in me.</p>
<h2 id="getting-attracted">Getting attracted</h2>
<p>By the time I was in medical school (2011), <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-was-your-first-programming-contest-experience/answer/Akshay-S-Dinesh?share=1">INOI had happened</a> and I had gotten really acquainted with the role of computers in the world and the state of free software in the world.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://dunebuggie.wordpress.com/">Shreyas</a>, my schoolmate in 11th and 12th, joined Mozilla and started blogging about his experiences. It was through his blogs and hyperlinks that I got acquainted with Mozilla&#39;s activities.</p>
<p>So, one day in June &#39;14&#39; he posted a link to Chennai Mozillians Facebook group about Firefox 29 launch party in Bangalore. Naturally I clicked on it and ended up signing up for an invitation.  June, 2014. Of I went to Bangalore on a cold night to attend what was to be my entry to Mozilla. There I met a lot of nice people and talked about all the thousand ways to get started. <a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/ankitgadgil/">Ankit Gadgil</a> gave me this wonderful idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every third tweet or Facebook status, what if you dedicate it to open source and open Web? Imagine how powerful that&#39;d be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kaustavdm.in/">Kaustav</a> talked about the code. And a lot of others about a lot of other things. All I could contribute was to Malayalam localization and <a href="https://mozillians.org/u/anivar">Anivar</a> suggested that I join the <a href="http://smc.org.in/">SMC</a> mailing list (and that led me to a lot of other things which is a story on its own)</p>
<h2 id="getting-serious">Getting serious</h2>
<p>Ever since, I started hanging around in Moznet IRC, and whichever mailing lists I could sign up for. I tried my hand in Army of Awesome, but Twitter wasn&#39;t helping the process. I would <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;emailtype1=exact&amp;emailreporter1=1&amp;email1=asdofindia%40gmail.com&amp;list_id=12324688">file bugs</a> on bugzilla, send PRs on various projects (like the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/apk-factory-service/pull/85/">apk-factory</a> bug which was the first whole night I spent coding, and then the <a href="https://github.com/emmairwin/mozilla-community-edu/pull/27">community education</a> <a href="https://github.com/emmairwin/mozilla-community-edu/pull/24">portal</a> - which earned me my first vouch). I tried starting a webmaker club but the most I could muster up was a <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2014/09/making-of-maker-party.html">webmaker party for my classmates</a>.</p>
<p>I signed up to be an FSA. In fact, I was already a Firefox ambassador in my college, but by signing up I became official.</p>
<p>As an FSA, and more because Shreyas was there and we were thinking of planning an activity in our school, I joined the FSA Bootcamp in Bangalore on Valentine&#39;s Day, 2015.  And then I started the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MMC_MedFox_Club">MMC MedFox Club</a> which has found a reasonable number of members, although not a proportional amount of activity.</p>
<p>It was in April 2015 that <a href="../net-neutrality/#trai-consultation-paper">TRAI released their consultation paper</a> to avoid net neutrality. And I joined <a href="http://blog.savetheinternet.in/the-people-behind-savetheinternet/">the savetheinternet team</a> to do whatever I could in preventing a broken Internet. The debate in India quickly stopped being about differential rating and started to be about zero rating. Mozilla did not have a public stance about zero rating then. And Mozilla India could not go ahead with a campaign against zero rating while Mozilla was still undecided. Jafar and I composed <a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/1231">a blog post</a> about the fight and Shreyas took it over to the policy advocacy team for their review. A little while passed and they replied that they were still forming an opinion about zero rating. I couldn&#39;t wait and I made a small fuss on <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/private/netpolicy/2015-April/000457.html">netpolicy mailing list</a> (link visible to members only) and <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-advocacy.org/t/net-neutrality-in-india-31-march-2015/35/6">advocacy discourse</a>. Later I apologized and there was what I believe was a <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/private/netpolicy/2015-April/000463.html">constructive discussion</a> too which was probably followed up elsewhere by other wonderful people of Mozilla India. Mozilla finally took an official stance about zero rating and the whole debate in India in a <a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/1287">letter to Prime Minister</a>.</p>
<p>This led to me getting an invitation to the <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2015/05/mozilla-india-task-force-meetup-2015.html">Mozilla India task force meetup 2015</a> where I joined the newly formed <a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/1397">policy and advocacy task force</a>. And that is also where I discovered my passion for documentation.</p>
<h2 id="policy-and-advocacy">Policy and Advocacy</h2>
<p>Policy and Advocacy are two faces of the same coin. And my activities there can be seen on the task force <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/India/task_force/Policy_and_Advocacy/Timeline">timeline</a>.</p>
<h2 id="participation-leadership-cohort">Participation Leadership Cohort</h2>
<p>I applied for Participation Global Gatherings 2015 to be a member of the cohort of leaders among Mozillians who&#39;ll guide participation in Mozilla in the coming year(s). On October 1, 2015 3 things happened. I got email being selected to both MozFest, London and Leadership Summit, Singapore. I passed third year MBBS completely. And I left for Kochi to attend Mozilla Kerala Community Meetup &#39;15.</p>
<h2 id="mozilla-kerala">Mozilla Kerala</h2>
<p>As a Malayali, it&#39;s natural that I&#39;m a member of Mozilla Kerala too. Although I was active in the Telegram group beforehand, the first time I join a Mozilla Kerala event is in <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2015/10/mozilla-kerala-community-meetup-15.html">Mozilla Kerala Community Meetup &#39;15</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mozilla-india-restructure">Mozilla India Restructure</h2>
<p>Towards the end of 2015, Mozilla India was not making the impact it should. And upon George Roter&#39;s initiation there was a restructure process. I had a <a href="http://asd.learnlearn.in/mozilla-india-restructure-proposal/">proposal of my own</a> among the paltry <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwDg_0rFagbyX3NuZFFNTzc3OUE">10</a> that came from the entire community. I later joined the strategy group, along with Kaustav and Deb in drafting a draft final structure for the community. This was the basis of the Mozilla India Meetup of 2016 where the community rebooted itself.</p>
