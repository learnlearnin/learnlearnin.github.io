Epidermis is the outermost layer of skin. And therefore receives almost all nutrition from diffused Oxygen.

It is almost 95% keratinocytes.

## Layers ##
From inside to outside

First, **Basement Membrane**, just between dermis and epidermis - a funny, non-cellular layer
### Stratum Basale ###
Stratum germinativum (where proliferation of keratinocytes happen). Attached to basement membrane by hemidesmosomes (antibodies against these cause bullous pemphigoid)

### Stratum Spinosum ###
The spines of this layer is a result of desmosomes holding cell membranes together. The remaining part that are not held tight can shrink and therefore a thorny appearance comes about.

Acantholysis is the loss of this cohesion between epidermal cells. "Acantho-" stands for spiny or thorny. And "lysis" is breakdown as usual.

Antibodies against desmosome proteins (desmoglein 1 and 3) are the cause of [Pemphigus Vulgaris](../pemphigus/#pemphigus-vulgaris)

### Stratum Granulosum ###
Nucleus lost, cytoplasm granular with leftovers.

### Stratum Lucidum ###
Member of thick skin.

### Stratum Corneum ###
Anucleated corneocytes.
