## Questions ##
These are [open questions](/open-questions/). Do [message me](/about/#contact) if you have something to say.
* Does the eye-ball float or sink in water?
* With its 3 coats - fibrous, vascular (uvea), and nervous (retina) - which other body part does the eyeball resemble?
* Which solid structures/layers in the eye are transparent? (I can think of 3)
* Is the bulbar conjunctiva attached to the sclera, the limbus, or the cornea?
* What separates bulbar conjuctiva from sclera? What happens to this separation when the conjunctiva gets attached?
* Why does the surface of the limbus area appear smooth? Why doesn't cornea look like a contact lens?
* Why is Tenon's capsule also called fascia bulbi? Does it move when the eyeball moves?
* What are check ligaments? Why are they called so?
* What is the suspensory ligament of eyeball (Lockwood's ligament)? How is it different from a check ligament?
* Where does local anaesthetic solution instilled in "sub Tenon's block" reach?

Thus begins [ophthalmology](/ophthalmology)
