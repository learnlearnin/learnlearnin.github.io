Installing f-droid allows you to [free your android phone](/free-android/) from [Google's stronghold](/quit-google/)

To install once you have enabled unknown sources in settings > security, download and install the [f-droid apk](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk) (direct link) from [their website](https://f-droid.org/).

That is it. You are done. Now you can start browsing and installing great free apps.
