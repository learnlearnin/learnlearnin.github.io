Facebook could have been the best thing on Internet. But the guys behind it have ruined it. It is now the antithesis of social networking.

## Open Web ##
Facebook is [killing](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426) the [open web](../open-web/)

## Censorship ##
Facebook does and again censor any content that it does not like, arbitarily, unilaterally, quite anti-socially. And no, I'm not talking about [removing pictures of breastfeeding mothers](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines).

* Nov 4, 2014: [Kiss of Love page blocked, reinstated](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kiss-of-love-page-blocked-reinstated/article6561544.ece) - 50,000 likes (This might have been [an account compromise](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kiss-of-love-facebook-page-accounts-hacked/article6560728.ece))
* April 12, 2015: Facebook [removes all shared links](https://twitter.com/nixxin/status/587168394354360320) of [AIB's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfY1NKrzqi0) in favor of net neutrality

I came to know about this on 9th Nov, 2015 and that's the day I [deleted my facebook profile](#delete-your-account).
* September, 2016: [Link to article containing the legendary war picture of Kim Phuc removed and the link to article criticizing this removal also removed](http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentar/Dear-Mark-I-am-writing-this-to-inform-you-that-I-shall-not-comply-with-your-requirement-to-remove-this-picture-604156b.html).

## Lies, misdirections ##
Facebook has created a "platform" (better called a partnership) titled Internet.org (better titled Facebook zero). For promoting this all kinds of lies have been sewn together about how it does not violate net neutrality, how it will bring Internet to the remote areas that do not have Internet yet, how it can even be called a set of basic services, etc.

To promote the above they went on a missed call campaign which operated like this:

* Facebook sends an SMS to people saying "If you support free Internet, miss call to <number>"
* Once the person gives a misscall, another SMS is received saying "muft main internet ka samarthan karne ke liye dhanyawad" (from VM-INTORG)

This is misleading at best and a blatant lie

## Squeezing money from pages ##
Despite pages receiving organic likes, the posts they make aren't seen by users because Facebook intentionally hides posts from people. This is so that Facebook can later ask pages to pay Facebook to "boost posts".

## Delete Your Account ##

On 9th November, 2015, (coincidentally, the 11th birthday of [firefox](../firefox/)) I [downloaded my data](https://www.facebook.com/help/212802592074644) and [permanently delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674/)d my Facebook account.
