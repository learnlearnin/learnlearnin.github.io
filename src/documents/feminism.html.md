I am a feminist.

That is, I believe that men and women are born equal and that any apparent differences in their capacities are only a result of biased interaction with the environment which we must strive to remove.

## Rape ##
It is a violent crime perpetuated by common people when they think the conditions are right.

## Organizations ##
These organizations are feminist.
* [HeForShe](http://heforshe.org/) - an international organization with Emma Watson leading it.
* [Blank Noise](http://blog.blanknoise.org/) is a movement which encourages action heroes to do things like they would want to do without having to listen to patriarchies. It is active in many cities of India.

## India's Daughter ##
[India's Daughter](/indias-daughter/) - A documentary by Leslee Udwin about December 16 gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh in Delhi. It documents the attitude of the guilty, their guilty lawyers, victim's friends and relatives, the public, and the judiciary. Some horrifying defences by the lawyers of the guilty - like "A woman is a flower, she should be protected, a man is like thorn, strong and tough.", and so many more worse things. Read the controversies surrounding it [here](/indias-daughter/)
