I love Firefox. I am a Firefox Student Ambassador. 

Firefox has a long history of working hard to give people choice when they were struggling with Internet Explorer.

But it is not for historic reasons that I use Firefox as my only browser. Firefox is fast, stable. It has a lot of addons which I love to use.

## Addons ##

* Adblock: I know blocking ads is not exactly good for web developers. But yeah, I can't live without adblock plus
* Greasemonkey: At such rare times when some website fails to provide things I *really* want to do, I use greasemonkey. The number of poke wars I've won on Facebook itself should make this a cool addon.
* [ImageBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-block/): Internet is sucky in India. And when it really sucks, blocking images is an easy way for faster page load, and lesser bandwidth. ImageBlock makes that painless.
* [Live HTTP Headers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-http-headers/): This is a nifty tool in the web hackers tool kit. I've used this to do a great deal of things I couldn't have done without it. Purchasing xiamoi phones for others using direct flipkart api link is only one of them
