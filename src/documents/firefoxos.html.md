FirefoxOS is a simple concept - every app is an [Open Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Intro_to_open_web_apps).

As of now FirefoxOS is stable and running on quite a few cool devices like [this huge panasonic TV](http://www.engadget.com/2015/01/05/panasonic-4k-tvs-with-firefox-os/) or [this cool transparent high end Japanese phone](http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_fx0_is_a_transparent_smartphone_running_firefox_os-news-10571.php).
