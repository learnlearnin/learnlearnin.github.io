I love free software. Free as in libre. Not as in gratis. Libre software is that which we can modify, share, copy, edit, dabble in, destroy, fork, spoon, fornicate, anything without restriction. Gratis is when you can download the software without paying money.

Open Source is when software's code is available for anyone to see. But just seeing, is sometimes of no use.

I believe that if the world were to use only free software, it would progress at a much faster rate than today.
