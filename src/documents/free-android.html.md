You [can quit google](../quit-google/) without it affecting you in any way. And you should quit Google.

But since you probably have an Android phone (without an official [Firefox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS) port) you are surrounded on all sides by Google. But since Google took help from everyone in making Android a success by making it "open source", we have CyanogenMod, Android Open Source Project (AOSP), etc coming to our rescue.

Here is how you get rid of Google from your phone.

## Easy way - which does not work ##

* Trust Google that it won't send your data via backdoors.
* Disable Google search, Gmail, Google Now Launcher, Google+, Google Hangouts, Youtube, Google Play Store, Google Play Music, Sync on all google accounts, everything with G on it via Settings -> Apps -> all apps -> app name -> disable (because uninstall is disabled)

## Slightly hard way - easily reversible - incomplete ##

* Root your phone
You most definitely have to find a way to root your phone by yourself. There is no one-click method for all the models. Just go to [forum.xda-developers.com](http://forum.xda-developers.com/) and search your phone model and find the root method. They usually have really detailed tutorials.

* [Install F-droid](../f-droid/)

* Install AFWall+ in whitelist mode and allow only your nice apps to communicate with internet.

## Harder way - retains android - more complete ##

* Flash [CyanogenMod](http://cyanogenmod.org/). xda is where you go again.
* Do not flash gapps (Most xda tutorials will end with a step "flash gapps for google apps"). Our purpose of installing CyanogenMod was to get rid of Google apps. So it makes no natural sense to flash the same.
* Install [f-droid](../f-droid) and alternate apps like:
  * Firefox
  * Telegram
  * Osmand~
  * AFWall+
  * K-9 Mail

## Even hard ##
Find a FirefoxOS build for your device or port one. Flash that.
