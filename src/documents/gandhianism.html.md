*My Experiments with Truth* was one among the first non-fiction books I read. Gandhi has certain ideas which are really practical, although counter-intuitive to many.

## Truth ##
Stating the truth requires courage. And such courage beats a lot of strength.

## Non-violence ##
There are unique ways to achieve any goal with no violence. Whatever is achieved through violence, stays only as long as the violence's effect lasts.

A prime example of this in practice is the Kiss of Love protest in Kerala. Whoever has used violence has failed. And whoever uses enlightening ways to protest have gained.
