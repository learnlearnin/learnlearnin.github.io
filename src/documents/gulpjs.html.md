Gulp is the slave of a front end [developer](../web-development/) to [DRY](../dry/) concatting, minifying, uglifying, compressing, and everything.

Read [this beautiful introduction by Travis Maynard](http://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp).

## Basics ##
The absolute basic of gulp is that everything is piped.

## Tips ##
Gulp runs tasks simultaneously. But sometimes you need to run them one after the other. For this, till [this issue](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/355) is solved, you can use run-sequence as [pointed out by Tomasz Bujnowicz](https://github.com/tomaszbujnowicz/html5-boilerplate-gulp-less/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L9). For a sample such gulpfile, see [my gulpy branch of diaspora yatra](https://gitlab.com/asdofindia/diasporayatra/blob/gulpjs/gulpfile.js)
