I love [computers](/computers/) (running [linux](/linux/)). They make life easy. I also love the [web](/web/). The web enables life on earth. Another of my loves is the human [mind](/mind/). It allows thinking about all this. That brings me to intelligence and [AI](/ai/).

## Learning ##
I believe in [learning](/learning/) things as efficiently as possible.

## Welcome to Learn Learnin' ##
This is a knowledge aggregator. You can click on all the links and reach a lot of nice places on the internet to read a lot of nice things about a lot of nice topics.

## Philosophy ##
I am a rationalist, I call myself an atheist, and I usually am proactive in getting involved in religious issues because there are [issues in religion](/issues-in-religion/). I am a [feminist](/feminism/).

## Medicine ##
There is very little organized information about medicine on the internet. There is no go-to website for a medical student to visit and read to their mind's content when they are bored. I plan to do something towards this here. Right now I have a couple of links for you: [Ophthalmology](/ophthalmology/)

## What?! ##
Okay, if you are coming here for the first time and you don't have a clue what is happening, read the [about](/about/) page.

## More ##
### Privacy ###
After Snowden's revelations about NSA (although Richard M Stallman has been trying to tell the same before) I became clearly interested in protecting my privacy. I [quit all services by google](/quit-google/). And I started using [pgp and public key cryptography](/public-key-cryptography/)
