India's Daughter exposes the naivity of "Indian culture". And no wonder, it was banned from airing in India by proponents of the same. 

The documentary describes the gang rape of Jyoti Singh (Nirbhaya) in excruciating details. Then focuses on how Mukesh Kumar (one of the rapists) and the defence lawyers (for the rapists) defend the act. The protests are covered and so are the issues in unreasonably demanding/issuing death penalty. 

I've seen it and it is a stable portrayal of the situation. There was no reason to ban it, and any [defence that the Government of India makes](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-serves-legal-notice-to-bbc-for-airing-the-controversial-documentary/article6963261.ece) are lame excuses.

These excuses might seem necessary because the truth is that rapists are not a special species of people, but members of the society who are waiting for their chance. It makes the word "Indian culture" (of looking down on women) sound really bad.

This is the documentary that has been unethically banned in India. It sheds a new light on complex socioeconomic and cultural state of India that determines the status of India's women in their society. On one hand, there is an increased awareness and new zeal to fight horrible crimes on women and on the other hand, the people with twisted and misguided ideas still cause harm to women in India.
