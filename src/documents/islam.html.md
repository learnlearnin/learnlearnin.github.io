I am an atheist. And I hold a grudge against all religions. And I scorn Islam.

Apparently, the holy grail of Islam is Quran. But the holy grail of Islam is blind faith. The first chapter of Quran itself deals with unquestioning belief in Quran.

Brought up in such extreme conditions I have no reason to believe that Islam can do any good to people. In fact, I believe, people who do good being Muslims are the people who can dissociate the realities of the world from the teachings of Islam.

Do not read this as a racist statement, but if you think that Quran is the absolute truth, I am forced to look down on you as an unreasonable person.

On the other hand, the perils of allowing such unquestioned belief in a book that can be interpreted in different ways by different (evil) religious leaders are so many. And quite frankly, it gets annoying sometimes, when Muslims refuse to use contraceptives, or vaccination, based on their religious beliefs.

If you read this and feel burnt, I have one message for you, "Grow up!"
