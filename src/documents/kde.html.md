I was a [Gnome](../gnome/) user for a few years till they started removing all features from apps under the disguise of simplicity. That's when I started with KDE for the first time and it was love at first sight.

I love KDE for many things:
* eye-candy
* infinite levels of configuration
* sane, configurable keyboard shortcuts for everything
* very good, usable set of apps
* kmail, akregator, kwrite, kate, what not?
