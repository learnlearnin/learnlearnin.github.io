Leprosy was (is) a scary disease for thousands of years. Because of the incurable disfigurement and physical disabilities it causes.

People were scared of being near patients. Because it was spread by Mycobacterium leprae through closeness, respiratory route (nasal droplets), etc. And it affects **anyone**, newborns to 70 year olds.

Yet, we have been able to eliminate it globally. (<1 in 10,000 cases). This is because of the Multi-Drug Therapy.

### Bacteriological Index ###
The count of bacteria in 100x oil immersion helps us in finding out the quantity of bacteria.

How do we grade it on a scale? Since bacteria grows exponentially, we use a logarithmic scale. Also, since the microscope is 100x, we start with 100 fields.

* 1+ If there's 1 bacillus in the beginning - . (ie, at least 1 bacillus every 100 fields)
* 2+ If there's 10 times that, at least 1 bacillus every 10 fields.
* 3+ if there's 10 times that, at least 1 bacillus every field.
* 4+ if there's 10 bacilli every field
* 5+ 100 bacilli
* 6+ 1000 bacilli.
