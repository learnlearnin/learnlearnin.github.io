Life is a property that emerges out of interaction between molecules.

It is not special.

## Emerging property ##
Many things are greater than the sum of their parts.

For example, take a painting. If you look at individual strokes or millimeter squares of the canvas, you do not see anything other than the paint itself. But when all the squares are put together, when all the strokes have been made, when you are looking at the big picture, you see a story.

Molecules are the building blocks of life. When they interact they resemble life.

## Specialty ##
A painting is special in that it already tells a story. In the same limited sense life is special. Because one life is different from the other.

Life is special in that other lives might depend on it. Lives are inter-dependent.

But life is not some kind of super natural special. Life is just chemical.
