At Mozilla Web Club Mysore, we come together to learn, explore, create, and participate in the World Wide Web.

Learners regularly meet up and grow their web literacy. Learning will be by making and "teaching" will be redefined. Club members also connect with peers in the global network of learners.

Our focus shall be on empowering learners to become web literate.
