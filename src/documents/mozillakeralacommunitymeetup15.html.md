I left for Kochi from Mysore on Oct 1 (the same day I received email from the participation team inviting me to participation leadership cohort and passed third year subjects). After about 8 hours of sleep I woke up at 4 in the bus to be involved in a very active discussion about misogyny/nitpicking in Mozillians telegram group.

After getting down from the bus I visited my brother and grandmother and had breakfast with them. Then, I reached Asset Summit Suites where everyone was getting ready.

## Day 1 ##
As usual, people reached late and the event started an hour late with introductions. Late comers had to dance. I was meeting everyone (except Anush and Kumaresan and Abin) for the first time. But Telegram and IRC and emails meant I knew most people and vice versa.

After tea we started talking about how decentralization of powers and privileges should be our agenda and how Mozilla Kerala should be a community based on SOPs. I threw in the idea that Mozilla Kerala should, whenever possible, work inside Mozilla (for example, wiki, discourse, etc) so that it's good for everyone.

Speaking of discourse, we chose to use the discourse.mozilla-community.org discourse's Kerala subcategory as the official discussion medium, IRC #kerala (with Telegram proxy bot and such stuff as required) for meetings, Gitter.im for development discussions, Mozilla Wiki/Kerala for documentation, Bugzilla.Mozillakerala.org for bugs, and so on.

After lunch we talked about what new initiatives to plan, what to focus on, etc.

Then, we developed [SOPs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Kerala/SOPs) for all things conceivable.

After dinner, I learned some meteor from Akhil and slept.
