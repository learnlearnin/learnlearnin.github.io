Either of [Shreyas](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/dunebuggie) or [Jafar](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/pmjcreations/) must have invited me to the Task Force meetup, and I got to be a part of the Mozilla India Task Forces.

The 2015's task forces were formed in an event at Bangalore (Lemon Tree hotel, Ulsoor lake) over 7, 8, 9, 10 May, 2015.

On 7th and 8th, it was previous task force members discussing, evaluating, etc and planning.

I reached the venue on 8th night.

## Day 1 ##
In the morning, [George Roter](http://georgeroter.org) talked about the mission of Mozilla and the goals for 2015.

Afterwards, there was an activity to recall what Input -> Activities -> Output -> Outcome -> Impact was.

After lunch, the task force concept was introduced. And all the task forces were introduced, including the newly proposed ones.

Then we divided into groups based on the task force we were interested in joining.

I joined [policy and advocacy task force](http://wiki.mozillaindia.org/Task_force/Policy_and_Advocacy) which was a newly formed Task Force to cover policy issues and also raise awareness about those, privacy, security, etc. We discussed our skills, our roles, our interests and what help we need. Later we aligned these to the Mozilla's 2015 goals. More about the Task Force in the wiki.

In the night, I downloaded the mozilla-central code from the mercurial repository and built my own firefox (ASDfox)

## Day 2 ##
Day 2 was really intensive. We wrote down our short term goals and long term goals for each task force.

George did a workshop on Fennec, we made personas, discovered a lot of ideas and challenges.

Towards the end, we finalized the strucutre of the task force and presented the important goals to the group.

[These notes are super short because there is too much going on and I don't even have time to note them down before forgetting, let alone expand.]
