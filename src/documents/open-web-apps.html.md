Read [this great introduction to Open Web Apps from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Intro_to_open_web_apps).

Open Web Apps are just websites with access to device features and follow Web specifications.

## WebIDE ##
Firefox now ships with an IDE for Web Developers, called the WebIDE. You might have to download the [Developer edition](https://affiliates.mozilla.org/referral/75178/) (affiliate link).

If you're on the stable version, in about:config make sure devtools.webide.enabled is set to true

Press Shift+F8 to launch the webIDE.

If you don't have a FirefoxOS phone, you'll need to download a simulator addon.

Once you have everything ready, you can start building :D
