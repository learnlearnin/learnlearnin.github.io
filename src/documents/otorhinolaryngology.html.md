## Outline ##
Antrum has tegmen antri on the top. On the skull, antrum is marked by suprameatal (MacEwen's) triangle which is under cymba conchae on a human with intact ear. The suprameatal triangle, as the name implies is above the external auditory meatus and below the temporal line on the skull, and between a tangent (dunno how to draw this) drawn from the posterior border of the EAM.
