Pemphigus is a group of immunologically mediated skin diseases.

Pemphigus means blister. Pemphigus is a term reserved for auto-antibody diseases where the antibody is against structures intra-epidermal (as opposed to sub-epidermal in bullous pemphigoid). Read [differences between pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid](/pemphigus-vulgaris-vs-bullous-pemphigoid/).

This loss of cohesion between epidermal cell is called **acantholysis**. "Acantho-" means spinous or thorny. Remember [the spinous layer of epidermis](/epidermis/#stratum-spinosum)?

## Pemphigus Vulgaris ##
PV is life threatening because a lot of epithelium is lost (just like in burns). Around 5% mortality.

Antibodies are against desmoglein 1 and 3 in desmosomes ([macula adherens](/cell-junctions/#macula-adherens)). This leaves the blister very flaccid and easily breaking leading to the following signs

### Nikolsky sign ###
The blister breaks when you just touch it. In fact, it is difficult to find an intact blister.

### Asboe-Hansen sign ###
Fancy way to say indirect Nikolsky sign or Nikolsky sign II. Blisters grow in size by extending to unblistered skin when pressure is put. Negative in the above video.

### Manage PV ###
By steroids along with steroid sparing drugs (immunosuppressants)
