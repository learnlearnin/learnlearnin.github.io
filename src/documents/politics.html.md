I believe in ideal politics although I know that it is not possible for idealists to survive in real life. I believe in textbook politics. I believe in parties that fight election based on their manifesto and live and breathe their ideology. I believe in honesty and transparency.

Also, I have certain preferences. I like parties that have a clear (and positive) stance on digital rights, electronic governance, privacy, online rights, censorship, free speech.

There are a few things I hate about parties. These include false promises, speeches targetted at less educated people (who might even form the majority) or unsophisticated people. This is, as Winston Churchill rightly pointed out, a problem of democracy itself.

With those in mind, here's a list of parties I like, in India.
* Communist Party
* [Aam Aadmi Party](http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/)

Here is a party I absolutely despise.
* BJP
