I love clean URLs. And I hate deadlinks.

## Clean URLs ##
Clean URLs are those beautiful URLs which are pleasing. Looking at them is like looking at baby puppies. Here's how I make them.
* [No www](http://no-www.org/) although you'll have [issues with heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/apex-domains#naked_domain__arecord_limitations)
* No characters other than alphabets in the domain name
* URLs always end with /
* No URL ends with .html, .php or anything. Let them end with /
* Everything lower case
* No unnecessary subfolders. example.com/blog/post/march/post-title is bad. Try example.com/post-title/

Here's an example of a perfect URL: `learnlearn.in/urls/`
