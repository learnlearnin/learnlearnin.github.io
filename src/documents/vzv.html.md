## VZV encephalitis ##
Confused with Herpes Viral encephalitis (by HSV1) and therefore less studied.

## Ophthalmic Zoster ##
Trigeminal nerve (V) - opthalmic branch

### Hutchinson's sign ###
Because the nasociliary branch of the trigeminal nerve innervates both the cornea and the lateral dorsum of the nose as well as the tip of the nose.

There is a Hutchinson's nail sign (Subungal melanoma) and a Hutchinson's triad (congenital syphilis)

## Ramsay Hunt Syndrome ##
