Web development is the process of creating websites.

The things that usually goes through a web developer's mind is what software shall power the website, how shall the user authentication be, how will the URLs look like, etc.

##Software##
###Dynamic###
Most websites run on old php frameworks like wordpress or drupal or joomla.

Nowadays node based web servers are on a high. So is django and others.
###Static###
Static (html) websites are the latest thing among coders and programmers. Like [this website](https://github.com/learnlearnin/learnlearnin.github.io) itself.
I use and love [docpad](/docpad/). But I've also used jekyll in the past. If you're starting on jekyll, you may as well checkout octopress.

###Automation###
Tools like [gulp.js](/gulpjs/) and yeoman allows you to automate most of the stuff in creating projects.
