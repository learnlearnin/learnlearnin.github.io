Web development is the process of creating websites.

The things that usually goes through a web developer's mind is what software shall power the website, how shall the user authentication be, how will the URLs look like, etc.

## Server-side ##
### Dynamic ###
Most websites run on old php frameworks like wordpress or drupal or joomla.

Nowadays node based web servers are on a high. So is django and others.
### Static ###
Static (html) websites are the latest thing among coders and programmers. Like [this website](https://github.com/learnlearnin/learnlearnin.github.io) itself.
I use and love [docpad](/docpad/). But I've also used jekyll in the past. If you're starting on jekyll, you may as well checkout octopress.

## Coding ##
### IDE ###
I use [atom editor](/atom-editor/) for coding web. Use autocomplete plugins, syntax highlighting, linter plugins (and beautifier if you can't write beautiful code on your own.)

### HTML ###
Write accessible, valid HTML.

### CSS ###
CSS can be hard to write manually. To make it easy there's [LESS](/less/) and SASS. These can be easily written and then converted to pure complete CSS easily.

## JavaScript ##
Avoid using JavaScript to do what could have been done with HTML. Sites that do not work with JavaScript off are a turn off.  

## Automation ##
Tools like [gulp.js](/gulpjs/) and yeoman allows you to automate most of the stuff in creating projects.

## DRY ##
[Don't Repeat Yourself](/dry/)
