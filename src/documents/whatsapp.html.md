I hate WhatsApp messenger for the following reasons.

* It is closed source, and
* It actively prohibits any kind of attempt at reverse engineering it and making a better product
* It does not work on desktop
* It does not work on more than one device at a time
* It does not care about the privacy of our phone numbers
* It is owned by Facebook
* It does not have a easy way for keeping the message history intact (its backup system sucks)
* It does not even look good on Android

And all these would have been fine if everything else was worse.

But I prefer [Telegram messenger](/telegram/) because it undoes many of these wrongs
