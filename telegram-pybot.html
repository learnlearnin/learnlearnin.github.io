    <p>Datamachine studios has developed <a href="https://github.com/datamachine/telegram-pybot">telegram-pybot</a> which is a beautiful, plugins based (similar to Yago&#39;s Lua based <a href="https://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot">telegram-bot</a>) Python bot.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://asdofindia.blogspot.com/2015/05/early-preview-telegram-pybot-telegram.html">read an introduction about it on my blog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dogfeeding">Dogfeeding</h2>
<p>Now that we have a Python bot framework there is no more an excuse to not write your own Jacondas or Anacondas or what not?</p>
<p>Below, I shall put together a small high level overview of all that needs to be understood so that one can directly jump into building plugins for telegram-pybot and enjoy it in group chats. For all the low level details, it is preferrable to read the linked code, source, or docs.</p>
<h2 id="the-chain">The chain</h2>
<p>All useful interaction with any bot is a long chain of calls between different programs. It is fun to think of the actual physical connection and the software connection. Just for that fun:</p>
<ul>
<li>You, from your Telegram client send a command, say &quot;/wiki Telegram&quot; to a group in which the bot is running.</li>
<li>Your telegram client converts into gibberish by encypting with MTProto and passes it over to your phone&#39;s data connection to be sent over.</li>
<li>The mobile data carrier, using air waves picks up the data at the cell tower and hoping through all loops the data reaches Telegram server.</li>
<li>Telegram server sends it to all members of the group, including the bot.</li>
<li>And <strong>here&#39;s where it gets interesting</strong>. The bot is running vysheng&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/vysheng/tg">tg</a>, which decodes the MTProto encryption. It then passes the details about the message (sender, recipient, text, etc.) through the Python bindings.</li>
<li>That&#39;s where telegram-pybot gets hold of the message. It runs it through the various plugins and passes control to the plugin that needs to run on each particular command.</li>
<li>The plugin itself does the most specialized job of applying logic and composing a response. This could be:<ul>
<li>A simple mapped response. Like, command &quot;Hi&quot; would return &quot;Hello&quot;</li>
<li>Some kind of processing and stuff. Say &quot;2+2&quot; returns &quot;4&quot;</li>
<li>Connecting to a web API/website and fetching a result. Say &quot;/wiki Telegram&quot; would go to wikipedia page on Telegram and fetch the first paragraph and respond with that. (<strong>This is the part we have to code</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the plugin returns something the whole chain runs in reverse and you get a reply to your command.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>This is the most difficult part or the easiest part depending on what you&#39;ve been doing with your computer in your life. Here are the essentials required:</p>
<ul>
<li>A GNU/Linux or Mac OS X operating system (because tg-cli runs only on these). I use <a href="../archlinux/">Arch Linux</a>.</li>
<li>Command line (Ctrl+Alt+T might work in most cases)</li>
<li>Python 3.4, virtualenv, pip, git, etc. (install as and when command not found is thrown)</li>
<li>An Internet connection</li>
<li>A text editor. I use <a href="../atom-editor/">atom</a>.</li>
<li>An alternate Telegram account. (Because the bot does not respond to its own messages)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="downloading">Downloading</h3>
<p>Assuming you&#39;ve all that handy, you can follow the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/datamachine/telegram-pybot#telegram-pybot">the readme</a> of telegram-pybot to clone itself, clone tg, configure and make tg, and even launch the bot.</p>
<h3 id="tg-cli">tg-cli</h3>
<p>This is probably the first biggest hurdle</p>
<h4 id="-newhere">#newhere</h4>
<p>If you&#39;ve never used tg-cli you&#39;ll be asked to enter your phone number. And the input won&#39;t work because the bot runs in a subprocess.</p>
<p>Just do this</p>
<pre><code>cd tg
bin/telegram-cli
</code></pre><p>enter your alternate phone number, verification code, and then</p>
<pre><code>safe_quit
cd ..
./launch.sh
</code></pre><h4 id="-oldhere">#oldhere</h4>
<p>If you have used tg-cli with your primary number once, the bot&#39;ll start running in that. And when I tried last night it wasn&#39;t able to respond to its own commands.</p>
<p>tg-cli comes with an excellent way to run multiple profiles. Profiles are defined in a <a href="https://github.com/vysheng/tg/blob/master/config.sample">config file</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the ~/.telegram-cli folder is used as the directory to save authentication info. There&#39;s a config file created in this folder automatically.  </p>
<p>Delete the ~/.telegram-cli folder, and follow #newhere steps to register your alternate number.</p>
<p>Later if you want to use your primary number, just create a new profile using ~/.telegram-cli/config and use -p switch while running bin/telegram-cli to choose that profile.</p>
<h3 id="launch">Launch</h3>
<p><code>./launch.sh</code> is our command to run the bot. It&#39;ll take care of everything.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>There is very little configuration to be done. In <code>permissions.conf</code>, <code>admins = 0</code> should become <code>admins = 1234567</code> if 1234567 is your Telegram user id. You can use tg-cli to find out your user id with the command <code>user_info YourName</code></p>
<h2 id="plugin-management">Plugin Management</h2>
<p>Plugin management is best done via a Telegram chat itself. Once you have added yourself as an admin, you will be authorized to use the PluginManager plugin and <code>!pkg update</code> will sync the plugin list. <code>pkg install dice</code> will install the dice plugin and so on.</p>
<h2 id="writing-your-own-plugin">Writing your own plugin</h2>
<p>This is the most interesting part.</p>
<h3 id="plugin-folder-structure">Plugin folder structure</h3>
<p>For the sake of avoiding git, maintaining plugin repo, etc, we will build plugins directly inside the plugins folder inside telegram-pybot. If you are interested to see how an advanced plugin would look like, checkout the folder structure of <a href="https://github.com/datamachine/telegram-pybot-spyfall/">spyfall</a></p>
<h3 id="sample-plugin">Sample plugin</h3>
<p>Use the echo plugin in plugins folder to base your work on. Let&#39;s call our new plugin &quot;ping-pong&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>cp echo.py pingpong.py
cp echo.plugin pingpong.plugin
</code></pre><p><code>pingpong.plugin</code> contains metadata about the plugin. Name and Module info are important in it. Change it to PingPong and pingpong respectively.</p>
<p><code>pingpong.py</code> contains the basics of a plugin. Read the comments beneath to see what each line in this file does. The new function of our plugin is to respond with pong when someone says /ping.</p>
<pre><code>import plugintypes
</code></pre><p>import plugintypes module so that we can subclass TelegramPlugin.</p>
<pre><code>class PingPongPlugin(plugintypes.TelegramPlugin):
</code></pre><p>define a class called PingPongPlugin which&#39;s a subclass of TelegramPlugin</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Just say pong when someone says ping
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre><p>This is just a docstring for developers</p>
<pre><code>    patterns = [
        &quot;^/ping$&quot;
    ]
</code></pre><p>define the patterns that need to be captured by the plugin. This does a regex matching and we will talk about matching later. <code>^</code> refers to the beginning of a line and <code>$</code> refers to the end of a line.</p>
<pre><code>    usage = [
        &quot;/ping: pongs&quot;,
    ]
</code></pre><p>This is the string that is shown when someone says !help PingPong</p>
<pre><code>    def run(self, msg, matches):
</code></pre><p>this is the function that&#39;ll run if our pattern matches. msg is the object that has all the information about the message that matched. matches is a python object that is the result of the match, it can be used to access the text that matched. We can ignore it now.</p>
<pre><code>        return &quot;pong&quot;
</code></pre><p>whatever is returned is send as a message back to the user. In this case, pong</p>
<h3 id="make-this-plugin-seen">Make this plugin seen</h3>
<p>To enable this plugin we can manually edit <code>plugins.conf</code> file and add <code>;;PingPong</code> to the default_plugins_to_load list. Then launch the bot.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern matching</h2>
<p>Pattern matching is an brain twister. Read Python docs of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/re.html">re module</a> to know how this works.</p>
<h2 id="advanced">Advanced</h2>
<p>Plugins are even more fun when you can effectively use git to keep your plugin updated and curate plugins in a repository. Checkout <a href="https://github.com/datamachine/telegram-pybot-emoticons">telegram-pybot-emoticons</a> to see a simple sample plugin structure.<br>The plugin repository structure can be seen <a href="https://github.com/datamachine/telegram-pybot-plugin-repo">here</a>. Although, a word of caution, there&#39;s a very good chance that this architecture will be overhauled soon.</p>
<h2 id="iteration">Iteration</h2>
<p>This page goes through an iterative write-feedback-improve cycle. Please <a href="../about/#contact">give me ideas</a> of how to improve this page.</p>
