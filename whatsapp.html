    <p>I hate WhatsApp messenger for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is closed source</li>
<li>It actively prohibits any kind of attempt at reverse engineering it and making a better product. Read what happened to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JoaquinCuiti%C3%B1oF/posts/RmMcNNVP4c4">WhatsApp MD</a>, <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/105">Whatsapp+</a></li>
<li>It does not work on desktop (okay, they have a sucky web support now)</li>
<li>It does not work on more than one device at a time</li>
<li>It does not care about the privacy of our phone numbers</li>
<li>It is owned by <a href="../facebook/">Facebook</a></li>
<li>It does not have a easy way for keeping the message history intact (its backup system sucks)</li>
<li>It does not even look good on Android</li>
</ul>
<p>And all these would have been fine if there were no better alternatives. But there is. I use <a href="../telegram/">Telegram messenger</a> because it undoes many of these wrongs</p>
<h2 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h2>
<p>In case you still have to use WhatsApp, please try to follow these etiquettes.</p>
<h3 id="group-admins">Group admins</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describe the group and ask permission before adding anyone to a group.</li>
<li>Alternatively, immediately after creating a new group, give a description of the group and make sure everyone is given a chance to leave immediately.</li>
<li>Have clear idea about what the group is about and discourage off-topic posts.</li>
<li>Warn and remove members who are ill mannered.</li>
<li>Give admin rights to a few capable people.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sharing-media">Sharing Media</h3>
<ul>
<li>While sharing audio/video follow it up with a description on what the media is about and why people should watch it. If it is a surprise (which does not involve the overused sudden voice after a brief period of silence), still try to give a description that does not give away the surprise part.</li>
<li>While sharing images, caption them. This is also useful in searching for old images.</li>
<li>Make sure the files you share are on-topic and appropriate for all participants in a group.</li>
<li>Mark NSFW media as such in description.</li>
<li>Avoid posting large number of media simultaneously and without warning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forwarding-messages">Forwarding messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not forward messages which you haven&#39;t read/watched/heard yourself.</li>
<li>When you forward a message, assume the responsibility over it as if you personally composed and sent it.</li>
<li>Do not forward messages that have the text &quot;please forward this to all/friends/groups&quot; in them. In case you want to, edit and cut that part of the message.</li>
<li>Do not forward chain forwards which are obvious hoaxes. If you aren&#39;t smart enough to figure out hoaxes, please do an online search about the content of the message. There are websites like <a href="http://www.snopes.com">snopes.com</a> and <a href="http://skepdic.com">skepdic.com</a> which slay these urban legends.</li>
<li>While forwarding, especially so, do not send off-topic messages to groups.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="personal-messages">Personal messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not add people to a broadcast list and send good morning, good afternoon messages with random SMS quotes. They can easily figure it out.</li>
<li>If someone does not reciprocate with good morning messages, do not continue sending them every day.</li>
<li>When you&#39;re messaging someone whom you do not know personally, introduce yourself first before talking about anything else.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that you&#39;ve read requests/questions even if you can&#39;t respond to the request/question immediately. Tell them that you&#39;ll come back to it later.</li>
</ul>
